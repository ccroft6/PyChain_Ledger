# PyChain Ledger
![Blockchain](./Images_Video/blockchain.jpeg)

The goal of this file is to build a blockchain-based ledger system that allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger. This file will also create a user-friendly web interface where users can add a block to the chain that includes sender, receiver, and amount information. Users can validate the chain, inspect any of the blocks, and adjust the block difficulty.

## Technologies 
In addition to the standard Python 3.9 libraries, this file uses the following libraries and/or dependencies:
* [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - turns data scripts into shareable web apps using python
* [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) - a decorator that is used to add generated special methods to classes
* [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) - provides runtime support for type hints
* [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) - supplies classes for manipulating dates and times
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language
* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) - implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms
